# Tx
Funding Tx = Confirmed, on chain tx that sends to A + B
Commitment Tx = Unpublished but publishable tx that spends the funding t
Channel = Funding Tx + Commitment Tx

# HTLC
HTLC is a payment model that basically says "I will pay you if you give me the preimage of a hash. If you don't give it to me I get my money back after a delay".

# Invoice
Preimage: Random number generated by the sender (payee). The preimage is revealed upon successful receipt of the payment.
Payment Hash: SHA256 hash of the preimage. A Lightning payment is made to this hash and can be claimed once the preimage is revealed.
