# Output types
pubkey: Script that pays to a public key directly (P2PK, <pubkey> OP_CHECKSIG); it has no corresponding address.
pubkeyhash: Script that pays to a public key's hash (P2PKH, OP_DUP OP_HASH160 <pubkeyhash> OP_EQUALVERIFY OP_CHECKSIG), corresponding to a 1... address.
scripthash: Script that pays to a script hash as defined by BIP16 (P2SH, OP_HASH160 <scripthash> OP_EQUAL), corresponding to a 3... address (defined in BIP13)
multisig: A (bare) k-of-n multisig script of the form <k> <pubkey1> <pubkey2> <pubkey3> ... <pubkey_n> <n> OP_CHECKMULTISIG; it has no correspondign address, and is very uncommon now.
witness_v0_keyhash: Native P2WPKH output defined in BIP141 (OP_0 <pubkeyhash>), corresponding to a 42-character bc1q... address (defined in BIP173).
witness_v0_scripthash: Native P2WSH output defined in BIP141 (OP_0 <scripthash>) corresponding to a 62-character bc1q... address (defined in BIP173).
witness_v1_taproot: P2TR output defined in BIP341 (OP_1 <tweaked pubkey>) corresponding to a 62-character bc1p... address (defined in BIP350).
witness_unknown: Native segwit output that isn't P2WPKH, P2WSH, or P2TR (OP_<n> <payload>, for n=1..17 and payload between 2 and 40 characters), corresponding any other BIP350 address.
nulldata: OP_RETURN output, burning coins.
nonstandard: Anything not in the list above

# Units

## Size in bytes
The size in [bytes] of a transaction refers to the raw byte length of its serialized format. 
It is used to measure the data footprint of transactions when relayed on the network or stored on disk.

## Size in vbytes
The vsize in [vbytes] refers to a transaction's weighted size under segwit's rules. 
It is used to compare how much blockweight needs to be allocated to confirm a transaction.

vsize [vB] = weight [wu] / 4

## Weight
The transaction size was measured in bytes before segwit. Since segwit, the relevant measure is transaction weight 
which is either given in virtualbytes (vbyte, vB) or weight units (wu) where 4 wu = 1 vB.
For segwit transactions, which do include witness data, the resulting transaction weight is strictly smaller than 4 Ã— size due to the witness bytes contributing at a lower factor. 
For non-segwit transactions, their size is equal to their virtualsize 1 B = 1 vB.
